 * @brief    Nordic UART Service implementation.
 *
 * @details The Nordic UART Service is a simple GATT-based service with TX and RX characteristics.
 *          Data received from the peer is passed to the application, and the data received
 *          from the application of this service is sent to the peer as Handle Value
 *          Notifications. This module demonstrates how to implement a custom GATT-based
 *          service and characteristics using the SoftDevice. The service
 *          is used by the application to send and receive ASCII text strings to and from the
 *          peer.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate SoftDevice events to the Nordic UART Service module
 *       by calling the ble_its_on_ble_evt() function from the ble_stack_handler callback.
